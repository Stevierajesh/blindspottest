"""Semantic mapper: hand a page snapshot to an LLM, get back testable candidates.

Provider-agnostic by construction. The classifier only knows about an
`LLMBackend` — anything that can take a system prompt, a user prompt, and a
JSON Schema, and return JSON text. Claude is the default backend because it
supports strict structured outputs, but nothing in the classification logic
depends on it.

Selecting a model:

    # explicit — the usual way
    classify(snapshot, backend=AnthropicBackend(model="claude-sonnet-5"))

    # environment
    BLINDSPOT_LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic BLINDSPOT_LLM_MODEL=claude-sonnet-5

    # your own provider
    register_backend("acme", lambda model: AcmeBackend(model or "acme-1"))

The boundary this module enforces: the LLM says "persistence testing applies
here", never "this is broken". Nothing downstream of `classify()` treats a
candidate as a defect.

You identify which interactions on a web page represent PERSISTENT, \
USER-CONTROLLED STATE — state a user sets, that is expected to survive a page \
reload.

You are given a simplified description of a page: its interactive elements, \
their roles, labels, current values, and nearby helper text. You return \
candidates that persistence testing should be applied to.

SCOPE — read this carefully:
  - Your job is "this LOOKS LIKE something persistence testing applies to."
  - Your job is NOT "this is broken." You have no evidence of behaviour; you \
are looking at a static description of a page that has not been interacted \
with. Nothing you see can tell you whether saving works.
  - Never speculate about bugs, data loss, or failures. `reasoning_summary` \
describes the EVIDENCE for your reading, not a defect.

WHAT QUALIFIES:
  - A FREE-TEXT field whose value the user would expect to persist: profile \
details, bios, display names, notes, descriptions.
  - Only these two shapes are in scope:
      * `"tag": "textarea"`
      * `"tag": "input"` with `"type": "text"` or `"type": "search"`
    Propose nothing else, however plausibly persistent it looks.
  - Pair it with the control that commits the change — usually a nearby \
button with text like Save, Update, Apply, or Submit.
  - If helper text indicates automatic saving ("saves automatically", \
"changes are saved as you type"), set `commit_action_id` to null and say so \
in `reasoning_summary`.

WHAT DOES NOT QUALIFY:
  - Any field outside the two shapes above. Checkboxes, radios, switches, \
selects/dropdowns, date and time pickers, number and range inputs, colour \
pickers, file uploads, and contenteditable rich-text editors are ALL out of \
scope for now — skip them silently, even when they clearly hold persistent \
state.
  - Email, url, and tel inputs. They look like text fields but enforce a \
format, so they are out of scope too.
  - Search boxes, filters, and sort controls — transient view state.
  - Login and signup fields, one-time codes, payment entry.
  - Fields marked `disabled` or `readonly`, or any element without \
`editable: true`.
  - Navigation links and buttons that only move between pages.

REFERENCES:
  - `field_id` and `commit_action_id` MUST be `id` values that appear in the \
snapshot you were given (e.g. "e3"). Never invent one.
  - `field_id` must name an element with `editable: true`.
  - `commit_action_id` must name a button or link, never an input field.

SUCCESS SIGNAL — how the page would confirm a save:
  - The only supported form is visible confirmation text: `type` is "text" \
and `expected_pattern` is a short lowercase substring, e.g. "saved \
successfully".
  - Base it on wording actually present in the snapshot, or clearly implied \
by it. Do not invent a confirmation message.
  - Set `success_signal` to null when the snapshot gives you nothing to go \
on. Null is much better than a guess: a wrong pattern makes the test \
inconclusive, while null lets the runner fall back to a weaker check.

APPLICABILITY_CONFIDENCE is how strongly the snapshot supports "the \
persistence invariant applies here" — NOT how likely the page is to be \
broken. You are not predicting defects. A clearly-labelled Bio field beside a \
Save button is high; an ambiguous unlabelled text input is low. Once the test \
runs, whether the value survived a reload is a deterministic comparison with \
no confidence attached.

Return only candidates you actually believe in. An empty list is a valid and \
correct answer for a page with no persistent state.\
